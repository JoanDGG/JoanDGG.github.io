# Welcome to Deverso
## Epic phrase in here 🤷‍♂️😎

This is a personal portfolio to showcase what I consider my best collection of work so far as well as a [brief introduction of myself](https://github.com/JoanDGG/JoanDGG.github.io/blob/main/README.md#introduction), thank you for reading!

## Introduction

Deverso (me) is a solodev studio focused on creating games that offer high-impact experiences, to think about life, appretiate the little things, and have fun :)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JoanDGG/JoanDGG.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
